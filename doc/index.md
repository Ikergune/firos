FIROS is a tool that helps connecting robots to the cloud. For this purpose it uses the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/) and the [FIWARE Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) as a way to publish and listen robot's data.

FIROS works as a translator between the robotics field and the cloud world, transforming ROS messages into NGSI to publish them in the cloud, and vice versa.
